# Testing Global HD Wallet Merchant Creation

## What Changed:
1. ✅ Replaced Tatum Virtual Accounts with Global HD Wallets
2. ✅ Created 6 Global HD Wallets (BTC, ETH, USDT-ETH, USDT-BSC, USDT-TRON, USDT-POLYGON)
3. ✅ Updated merchant creation to use MerchantBalance system
4. ✅ Each merchant gets balance records for all currencies automatically

## Expected Results:
- Merchant creation should be much faster (no Tatum API calls during creation)
- Should create 6 balance records (one per global wallet)
- No more "unsupported currency" errors
- All balances start at 0.00

## Test Steps:
1. Navigate to /dashboard/merchants/create
2. Create a new merchant
3. Check balances in dashboard
4. Verify all 6 currencies are present with 0.00 balances

## Global HD Wallets Created:
- BTC (bitcoin network)
- ETH (ethereum network)  
- USDT (ethereum network) - ERC-20 token
- USDT (bsc network) - BEP-20 token
- USDT (tron network) - TRC-20 token
- USDT (polygon network) - Polygon token

## Architecture Benefits:
- ✅ Simplified: 6 global wallets instead of thousands per merchant
- ✅ Scalable: Database-only balance tracking
- ✅ Efficient: No API calls during merchant creation
- ✅ Standard: How Coinbase Commerce, BitPay work
- ✅ Fast: Instant balance updates
