# Solana and Generating Addresses (KMS)

With Solana and KMS, unlike other blockchains, it's required the mnemonic to generate public addresses. 

To streamline the process of working with KMS and Solana, it is recommended to generate the public addresses of your wallets in advance via the mnemonic and import them into KMS. 

## Good to Know

- When working with KMS, Solana, and Virtual Accounts, you may assign these addresses.
- Mnemonics are generally stored in KMS, while the public addresses are generated via the XPUB. Unfortunately, KMS does not support this method with Solana.
